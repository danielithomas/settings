# Setup

Setup for various environments

1. You should just be able to run `install-scripts.sh` and that's that. It will then run the install scripts for the given environment (Mac or linux). After it finishes this, the install config script will run, piping the config-bashrc.txt contents into your `.bashrc` 

## Items installed:

1. Some terminal fun: fortune, cowsay, lolcat (so so much lolcat)
1. Gnome tweaks etc.
1. Then several snap installs: VS Code, Powershell and the Dotnet sdk. 

I'm not currently setting up / installing other items such as Spotify & Discord (I probably should). However, I have a `todo:` on my list to pull the latest msteams `.deb` file and install that.

## Notes

1. The mac version is kinda "a bit stale" since I'm moving away from that platform.
